# Welcome !

I saw this [Rosa Restaurant Website from Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/1560982-Rosa-Restaurant-Website) project and built with React + SASS. <br/>
While creating this project, I used features such as CSS Grid, Animation, Pseudo and I had the chance to improve myself in these features. I also tried to build the loading screen using Hooks.

## [Live Demo](https://rosa-restaurant.vercel.app)

#### Tools

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [React Reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/)

#### First, Install deps

```bash
$ yarn install
```

#### In the project directory, run the development server::

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
